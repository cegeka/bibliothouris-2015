   'Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software '

      || 'take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion '
      || 'of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, '
      || 'and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven '
      || 'refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step '
      || 'instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works. '
      || 'The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable '
